## Problem Statement

We want to analyze how the mortality
rate of a given state is affected by
various environmental factors viz. Air
quality, water quality, sanitation, climate,
etc.

## Motivation

**_“Mortality projections are an essential
input for projections of the financial
development of pension schemes and
health and social policy planning. ”_**
Traditionally mortality models are used
for forecasting mortality for older
generations (ages over 50) since these
mostly affect the uncertainty in the
value of financial instruments offered by
pension funds due to improvements in
mortality and longer life expectancy. But
we are trying to model mortality rates in
general based on environmental change
factors such as air quality, water quality,
sanitation, etc. to see how
environmental deterioration leads to
change in mortality rates of us, humans.

This will give us useful insights into how
much of an effect can we handle and
how much deterioration will lead us to

## Dataset

We’re using the dataset provided in the
https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/mort
ality​. We’ll only use features related to
environmental factors.

## Solution

We’ll use Machine Learning to solve the
problem. We’ll use a wide variety of
environmental features to predict the
changes in mortality rate.

## Major Thematic Areas

It caters to CLIMATE CHANGE and all
OTHERS too. It’s an all-pervasive one.
